# FPGA-Coursera-Course
## Coursera Specialization on FPGA Design for Embedded Systems (by University of Colorado Boulder)

This specialization consists of 4 courses:-
1) Introduction to FPGA Design for Embedded Systems
2) Hardware Description Languages for FPGA Design
3) FPGA Softcore Processors and IP Acquisition
4) FPGA Capstone : Building FPGA Projects

I have completed first 3 of the 4 courses, but to the 4th one it requires me to buy a legit max 10 FPGA (which costs like 10$). So I am uploading all resources which I have, so that others may get help and not face the same problem which I did during this course. Since these courses are very fast-forward and over the head, solving the assignments and quizzes is no fun. So this is my small gift to all electronics engineering enthusiasts ;)
